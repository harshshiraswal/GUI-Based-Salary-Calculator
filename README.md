A GUI-based salary calculator developed during my summer vocational training at Opto Electronics Factory (OLF) after 1st year of B.Tech CSE.

## 📖 Project Background

This was my **first ever programming project** created during vocational training at OLF. As a first-year engineering student, I taught myself Java concepts and GUI development to create this salary calculator that performs real-time calculations without using databases.

**Key Challenge**: Connecting backend calculations with frontend GUI was a major learning experience at that time.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time salary calculations
- GUI built with Tkinter
- No database required
- Calculates various components:
  - Basic Pay + DA (Dearness Allowance)
  - HRA (House Rent Allowance)
  - CEA (Child Education Allowance)
  - TPT, IDA, and other allowances
  - Net pay comparison

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** with Tkinter for GUI
- **Backend**: Pure Python calculations
- **Frontend**: Tkinter widgets
